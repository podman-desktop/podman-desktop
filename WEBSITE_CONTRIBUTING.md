## Propose a Blog post

### Create a new author information

If you are not yet an author on Podman Desktop blog, you'll need to add yourself to the list of authors in `blog/authors.yml` following this pattern:

```yaml
authorid:
  name: Your Name
  title: Your Title
  url: your GitHub link
  image_url: <your GitHub link>.png
```

### Create a new post

In order to propose a new blog post, you'll need to do a pull request on the repository. Posts are authored as markdown files and are following a specific pattern:

```md
---
title: Title of the blog post
description: Description and short summary of the post
slug: Unique identifier of the page used for the URL (example: podman-desktop-release-1.11).
authors: Your author ID on podman desktop blog
tags: Tags for the post (example: [podman-desktop, release, podman])
hide_table_of_contents: false
image: Path to the hero image for the post (example: /img/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.11/banner.png).
---
```

If you need to include images and videos, you'll need to create a new folder in `blog/img`

### Videos

If you want to include gifs and videos in your blog post, you'll need to import the following player at the top of your content:
`import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'`

Then in your blog post content use the following (and replace the URL):
`<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url="path to your video file" width='100%' height='100%' />`

## Documentation information

All documentation is located within [/website/docs](/website/docs).

The website is built using [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and published to [podman-desktop.io](https://podman-desktop.io) on each commit.

### Tips

- When referring to a clickable button in the interface, **bold** the name. For example, click the **Extensions** button.
- Use backticks for all non-GUI items, including commands, variables, parameters, flags, environment variables, user inputs, names for individual API objects, RPM packages, file or image names, and directory paths. For example, use a valid registry path in the format `registry/repo/image:version`.
- Use notes, warnings, or tips only when you need to highlight important information or draw users' attention to a specific detail. For example:

  :::note

  If you do not have hands-on experience and want to explore, use the [minimal, webview, or full template](/docs/extensions/templates) to create a Podman Desktop extension.

## Previewing the website

The website can be previewed by running the following command:

```sh
pnpm website:dev
```

Which will automatically open your browser to `localhost:3000`.

You may also build a "production-like" environment by using:

```sh
pnpm website:prod
```

## Pull request previews

On each pull request, we use ArgosCI to do screenshot comparisons to check for any major changes. This may have to be manually approved.

## Formatting and lint checking

Formatting and lint checking can be examined by running the following commands:

```sh
# Markdown formatting
pnpm format:check
pnpm format:fix

# Markdown lint checking
pnpm markdownlint:check
pnpm markdownlint:fix
```

## Screenshot and video standards

We want to maintain **consistency** between screenshots that make it readable for all users.

### Screenshots

Ideally your screenshot should be:

- 1060px width
- 710px height
- Have a very small border
- Ideally have a transparent background

This matches the ratio of Podman Desktop's default size of 1050x700 as well as gives a few pixels spacing for a border.

Tips:

- Use a **red** circle or rectangle to emphasize points of interest and draw the user's eye to them.
- If you are unable to put the entire example in the screenshot, **zoom out** Podman Desktop (View -> Zoom Out) and re-take the screenshot.

### Video & gifs

Gifs and video are acceptable granted they are:

- Small in size (under 3mb)
- Less than 10 seconds long
- Uses compression. For gifs, use software such as [gifski](https://gif.ski/) with CLI commands such as `--fps 10 --quality 70`.

## Templates

Below are some "templates" to be used when writing documentation.

These do not encompass all scenarios, but gives you a foundation of how to write documentation.

### Metadata

All files should have the following metadata:

```
---
title: Your title
description: Small one sentence description
sidebar_position: 1 # Weight depending on the position you want
keywords: [multiple, keywords, as-needed]
tags: [category]
---
```

### Standard template

The most common template that requires a prerequisites section and "tutorial" / procedural section in order to teach the user something.

```markdown

#### Procedure

<Typically a numbered list of steps, although not an enforced standard>
