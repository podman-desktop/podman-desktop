# Release process for Podman Desktop

## Pre-requisites

- Create Enhancement Issue `Release vX.X.X` for current sprint (if such an issue does not already exist), then update the label to `kind/release` and assign it to yourself.
- Confirm with Podman Desktop maintainers that pending / need-to-go-in PR's have been merged.
- Notify main contributors on Discord / Slack.
- Release notes for the blog: Communicate with the person who has been tasked with creating the documentation. If you are assigned, see the below ["Documentation"](#documentation) section.

In the below example, we will pretend that we're upgrading from `0.11.0` to `0.12.0`. Please use the CORRECT release numbers as these are just example numbers.

## Release timeline

Below is what a typical release week may look like (This is just an example of timeline, some tasks may require extra days to complete):

- **Monday (Notify):** 48-hour notification. Communicate to maintainers and public channels a release will be cut on Wednesday and to merge any pending PRs. Inform QE team. Start work on blog post as it is usually the longest part of the release process.
- **Tuesday (Staging, Testing & Blog):** Stage the release (see instructions below) to create a new cut of the release to test. Test the pre-release (master branch) build briefly. Get feedback from committers (if applicable). Push the blog post for review (as it usually takes a few back-and-forth reviews on documentation).
- **Wednesday (Release):** Cut the new release using the below release process. The release will take 24 hours for release to hit all release channels (Flatpak, Brew, Chocolatey, etc.). We aim to have a release out _by Thursday_ so we do not have any surprises leading into the weekend.
- **Thursday (Post-release Testing & Blog):** Test the post-release build briefly for any critical bugs. Confirm that new release has been pushed to all release channels. Push the blog post live. Get a known issues list together from QE and publish to the Podman Desktop Discussions, link to this from the release notes.
- **Friday (Communicate):** Friday is statistically the best day for new announcements. Post on internal channels. Post on reddit, hackernews, twitter, etc.

## Releasing on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/actions/workflows/release.yaml
1. Click on the top right drop-down menu `Run workflow`
1. Enter the name of the release. Example: `0.12.0` (DO NOT use the v prefix like v0.12.0)
1. Specify the branch to use for the new release. It's main for all major releases. For a bugfix release, you'll select a different branch.
1. Click on the `Run workflow` button.
1. Note: `Run workflow` takes approximately 30-50 minutes. Brew a coffee, work on the release notes, and/or complete the next two steps while you wait.
1. Close the milestone for the respective release, make sure that all tasks within the milestone are completed / updated before closing. https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/milestones
1. If not already created, click on `New Milestone` and create a new milestone for the NEXT release.
1. Check that https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/actions/workflows/release.yaml has been completed. Sometimes it will flake, so you may need to re-run it.
1. There should be an automated PR that has been created. Approve this and set to auto-merge. This will be automatically merged in after all tests have been ran (takes 10-30 minutes). The title looks like `chore: üì¢ Bump version to 0.13.0`. Rerun workflow manually if some of e2e tests are failing.
1. Above PR MUST be merged before continuing with the steps.
1. Edit the new release https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/releases/edit/v0.12.0
1. Select previous tag (v0.11.0) and click on `Generate release notes` and then click on `Update release`
1. üö® Create the flathub PR once the release is available. This allows users to test the new version. We will hold the merge until it is approved.
1. The flathub workflow will create an automated PR to the flathub repository https://github.com/flathub/io.podman_desktop.PodmanDesktop

- Go to https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/actions/workflows/publish-flathub.yaml
- Click on the top right drop-down `Run workflow`
- Enter the release version `0.12.0` for example. DO NOT add the `v`
- Click `Run workflow`
- You can view the PR at: https://github.com/flathub/io.podman_desktop.PodmanDesktop/pulls/podman-desktop-bot

## Test release before it is rolling out.

The release is a **pre-release**, it means it is not yet the latest version, so no clients will automatically update to this version.

Inform QE the **pre-release** is out! It allows QE (and everyone else) to download and test these binaries before they go live or are in the package managers.

The release may be tested using the assets generated within the pre-release.

## QE and cherry picking fixes

- ‚ùå All critical bugs and regressions reported by QE are investigated and reviewed. If we determine that any of these issues warrant blocking the release, the necessary fixes will be implemented, and a new release candidate will be created‚Äîincrementing the patch version (e.g., 0.12.1 instead of 0.12.0).

**Cherry picking:**

If there are fixes that need to be made to the release as brought up by QE the following steps need to be completed:

1. Create a branch **FROM THE RELEASE**. Example, 0.12.x of release 0.12.0. **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Literally `0.12.x` not `0.12.1`.
2. Create PR(s) with the fixes that merge into the main branch and use mergify.io to open a backport PR(s) to the 0.12.x branch by adding the following comment in the main PR(s): `@Mergifyio backport 0.12.x`
3. Make sure all PR's are merged

**Re-spin a release:**

You'll need to create another release from the 0.12.x branch. This can be done by doing the following:

1. Go to `Run workflow` in the [release steps](/RELEASE.md#releasing-on-github) again.
2. **MAKE SURE** you specify that you want to use the `0.12.x` branch, NOT `main` under `Branch to use for the release`.
3. Version to release should be `0.12.1` **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Literally `0.12.1` NOT the branch name `0.12.x`.

## Change from pre-release to release

‚úÖ If QE agrees with the release, we have a green light!

1. Ensure release notes PR is ready
1. Merge the release notes before flagging the release as the 'latest': It is because Podman Desktop is displaying in the UI the release notes of the new release, so as soon as there is an update, the data needs to be there.

**DO NOT FORGET to change from pre-release to release!**

This is done on your release URL

**Do not forget to change the release from 'pre-release' to 'latest release' before proceeding**.

1.  Go to your release: https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/releases/tag/vX.X.X
2.  Press the edit button.
3.  Uncheck `Set as a pre-release`

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Only the .z version that was approved by QE should be changed from pre-release to release. Any previous blocked versions need to stay as pre-release. For example, if the respin version `0.12.1` was approved by QE after finding bugs in `0.12.0`, only `0.12.1` should be moved from pre-release to release.
