# Starting a recipe (inference server) for a model

Once an AI model is available through a well known endpoint, it's easy to imagine a new world of applications that will connect and use the AI model. Podman AI Lab support AI applications as a set of containers that are connected together.

Podman AI Lab includes a Recipes Catalog that helps you navigate several core AI use cases and problem domains, such as chatbots, code generators, and text summarizers. Each recipe includes detailed explanations and sample applications that can be run with various large language models (LLMs). Experimenting with multiple models allows you to find the optimal one for your use case.
