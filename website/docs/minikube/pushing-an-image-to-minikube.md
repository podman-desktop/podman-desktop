# Pushing an image to your local Minikube-powered Kubernetes cluster

With Podman Desktop, you can push an image to your local Minikube-powered Kubernetes cluster.

- [You onboarded a container engine](/docs/containers).
- [You onboarded a Minikube cluster](/docs/minikube).
- [You have set your Kubernetes context to your Minikube cluster](/docs/minikube/working-with-your-local-minikube-cluster).
- Your image is available on the **Images** page: `<my_image>:<my_tag>`.

1. Click **OK**.

#### Verification

Minikube enables you to list loaded images:

```command
$ minikube image list
```

You can also create a pod that uses the loaded image:

1. Create a `verify_my_image.yaml` Kubernetes YAML file on your workstation.
   Replace the placeholders:
   - Pod `name` and container `name` values must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters, '-', or '.', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
   - Container `image` value is the image you pushed. You can click the name of the image to check its name and tag.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: <verify-my-image>
   spec:
     containers:
       - name: <my-image>
         image: <my_image>:<my_tag>
         imagePullPolicy: Never
   ```

1. Go to **Kubernetes > Pods** from the left navigation pane.
1. Click **Apply YAML**, and select the `verify_my_image.yaml` file from your workstation. A confirmation notification opens.
1. Click **OK**.
   1.View the created pod `verify-my-image`. The pod **STATUS** is **RUNNING**.
