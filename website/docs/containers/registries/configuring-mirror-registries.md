# Configuring a mirror registry

You can add registry locations and configure their mirrors by using the Podman Desktop UI. By configuring a mirror, you can redirect a registry to another location and use its content, such as images, files, and other resources during development.

#### Prerequisites

- [Recreate your Podman machine](/docs/podman/creating-a-podman-machine) to mount the registry configuration file.
- Upgrade to the latest version of Podman.

#### Procedure

1. Go to the **Settings > Resources** page.
1. Select **More Options > Setup registry configuration** in the Podman tile. A command palette opens.
