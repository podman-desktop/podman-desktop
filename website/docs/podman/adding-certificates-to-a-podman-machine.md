# Adding certificates to a Podman machine

You can add certificates from your local certificate authority (CA) or from a third-party vendor into a Podman machine. After adding these certificates, you can use them in your images to:

- Secure the communication channel between the running applications in your container and the external host system
- Validate the SSL or TLS certificates provided by external services for authentication

#### Prerequisites

- A running [Podman machine](/docs/podman/creating-a-podman-machine).
- Obtained the required certificates for installation, such as _certificate.pem_ or _certificate.crt_.

#### Procedure

1. Start an interactive session with the default Podman machine:

```sh
$ podman machine ssh <machine_name>
```

2. Optional: Switch to a root shell only if Podman runs in the default rootless mode:

```sh
$ sudo su -
```

3. Change to the directory where the certificates must be placed:

```sh
$ cd /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
```

4. Perform one of the following steps:

- Use the `curl` command to download a certificate:

  ```sh
  $ curl [-k] -o <my-certificate> https://<my-server.com/my-certificate>
  ```

- Use any editor, such as Notepad or Vim to create a certificate file with .crt, .cer, or .pem extension.

  :::note

  You can convert a certificate file to a text file and copy its content to the editor.

5. Add the certificate to the list of trusted certificates:

```sh
$ update-ca-trust
```

6. Optional: Run the `exit` command to exit the root shell.

```sh
$ exit
```

7. Run the `exit` command to exit the Podman machine.

8. Optional: Reboot the Podman machine.

```sh
$ podman machine stop <machine_name>
$ podman machine start <machine_name>
```
