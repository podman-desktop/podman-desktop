## Release details

### Explore Features Section on the Dashboard

The new Explore Features section on the Podman Desktop Dashboard helps you quickly
discover and use key features, accelerating your onboarding experience.
From this intuitive section, you can easily:

- Create containers
- Manage Kubernetes resources
- Browse the Extensions Catalog
- Configure Docker compatibility

    dark: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.22/explore-features-dark.png').default,
  }}
/>

### Switching Podman Machines Between Rootless and Rootful (macOS and Windows Only)

Podman allows containers to run in rootful (privileged) or rootless (non-privileged) modes,
balancing security, flexibility, and system access. Now you can toggle an existing Podman
machine between these modes using a simple ‚ÄúRun with root privileges‚Äù switch in the UI,
eliminating the need to recreate the machine.

  }}
/>

### Apply Kubernetes YAML Files with Ease

The new 'Create File from Scratch' option on the Play Kubernetes YAML page provides an integrated
text editor where you can write YAML from scratch or paste existing YAML artifacts. With syntax
highlighting and validation, the editor ensures accurate YAML creation and reduces deployment
errors. To use it, navigate to the Play Kubernetes YAML page, select 'Create File from Scratch',
paste or write your YAML, and click 'Apply' to deploy to your cluster. This enhancement simplifies
Kubernetes resource management, enabling developers to deploy pods, services, or other resources
efficiently in both local and remote cluster environments.

    dark: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.22/create-pod-from-kubernetes-yaml-dark.png').default,
  }}
/>

### Transparent Proxy Support

To ensure applications work seamlessly with transparent proxies, developers must configure
the client environment appropriately. This typically involves adding the transparent proxy‚Äôs
CA certificate to the system‚Äôs certificate store. Podman Desktop now leverages these CA
certificates for HTTPS requests, eliminating the `Self signed certificate in certificate
chain` error when downloading CLI tools or interacting with services outside the local
network. This enhancement simplifies workflows in enterprise environments with transparent
proxies, ensuring smooth access to external resources and streamlined CLI tool management.

### Include arm64 Podman Installer for Windows

Starting with Podman v5.5, native ARM64 binaries are available for Windows, enabling better
performance and compatibility on ARM-based devices. Podman Desktop now includes both ARM64
and AMD64 Podman installers, automatically selecting the appropriate version based on your
system architecture. This enhancement ensures a seamless setup experience for Windows users
on modern ARM64 devices.

### Podman Desktop Main Window Display Issue on Linux with Wayland

A known bug [#14387](https://github.com/podman-desktop/podman-desktop/issues/14387)
in Podman Desktop may prevent the main window from displaying after start on Linux systems
running Wayland, due to a regression issue [#48430](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/48430) in Electron where the `ready-to-show` event fails to trigger correctly.
As a workaround, users running binaries directly can set the environment variable
`XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11` in the same command line (e.g., `XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11 podman-desktop`)
to force the application to use the XWayland (X11 backend) within a Wayland session, ensuring
proper window rendering. This is necessary because the user environment may already have
`XDG_SESSION_TYPE` set to `wayland`. This workaround is not required for Flatpak packages, as
`XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11` is automatically added during Flatpak execution,
making them unaffected by this regression.
