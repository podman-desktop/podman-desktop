# Hacktoberfest 2025! - Contribute to Podman Desktop

October is here and [**Hacktoberfest**](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is back! It’s the perfect opportunity to sharpen your skills, explore open source, and contribute to [**Podman Desktop** ](https://podman-desktop.io/) — an open source tool designed to simplify working with containers and Kubernetes from your local machine.

## Why Contribute to Podman Desktop?

Podman Desktop is built with developers in mind. **Designed by developers, for developers** !!
It’s a cross-platform tool that helps streamline container workflows, offering features like:

- **Container management** Manage your containers, images, and pods directly from your desktop.
- **Kubernetes integration** Run and test workloads in a local Kubernetes environment.
- **Extension framework** Build custom extensions to expand and personalize the desktop experience.
- **Modern tech stack** Contribute using TypeScript, Svelte, Tailwind CSS, Electron, Playwright and more!

And really—what could be more rewarding for a developer than working on a tool that benefits both our peers and ourselves?

Whether you’re fixing a bug, enhancing the UI, or creating a new extension, your contributions will help shape the next generation of container tooling.

## Contribution Areas

Here are some ways developers can get involved:

- 🐛 **Bug Fixes** – Help identify and resolve issues in the desktop app.
- 📝 **Documentation** – Refine guides and technical docs to make it easier for others to onboard.
- 🔌 **Extensions** – Build or improve extensions to extend Podman Desktop’s functionality.
