## Release details üîç

### ‚ú® Enhancements

#### Updated dashboard notification design

Dashboard notifications now follow the same design as the latest extensions (e.g., AI Lab). This enhancement ensures consistency in the user interface by implementing the updated notification design. The change addresses the visual inconsistency between dashboard notifications and newer extension notifications, providing a more cohesive and polished user experience.

  }}
/>

#### Notify when multiple Podman installations are detected

Added a notification system to detect and warn users when they have multiple Podman installations (e.g., one installed through the website download and another through Homebrew). This enhancement addresses the issue where duplicate installations can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the UI displaying outdated version information even after running brew update. The notification informs users of the duplicate installation situation, allowing them to uninstall one version to resolve potential conflicts.

  }}
/>

#### Update Podman to v5.6.0

Updated the Podman engine to version 5.6.0, which was released on August 15, 2025. This update ensures that Podman Desktop users have access to the latest features, improvements, and bug fixes from the Podman project. The upgrade maintains compatibility and provides enhanced functionality for container management and orchestration tasks.

More information about Podman release are available on [Podman 5.6 Released](https://blog.podman.io/2025/08/podman-5-6-released/) and [Podman 5.6 Released: Rosetta Status Update](https://blog.podman.io/2025/08/podman-5-6-released-rosetta-status-update/) blog posts.

#### Make libkrun the default when creating a Podman machine

Changed the default provider from AppleHV to libkrun when creating new Podman machines on macOS. This enhancement ensures that the default provider is synchronized with the CLI configuration, particularly for first-time users or when no existing machines are present. The change addresses the need for users to recreate machines when switching to AI model support, providing a more seamless experience.
